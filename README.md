# The Covid Times

# Inspiration
During these trying times we wanted to create something which would allow everyone to access information related to COVID-19 in one place.

# What it does
The Covid Times provides readers with a platform to find latest news and updates regarding the Covid-19 pandemic all in once place. Moreover, it also allows users to get country - specific information and statistics. It creates awareness about the common symptoms and puts light on the basic social distancing guidelines issued by governments all over the world.

# How we built it
We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create our website. We learnt about different ways we could style our page. We also used JavaScript to fetch a country-wise data from an external API.

# Challenges we ran into
Finding the right API was a tiring task, since there are very limited APIs that allow users filter the data country-wise. Getting to incorporate the JSON data, fetched from an API, inside the HTML also required some decent lines of code to be written.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build an interactive website, including the Frontend with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Backend API programming with JavaScript, within 36 hours

# What we learned
We learnt the functionality of Git and GitHub. We also learnt a little of bootstrap and its inclusion in CSS and HTML files. Apart from that, we also learnt to fetch data from an external API and incorporate it in a HTML file.

# What's next for The Covid Times
In order to improve the website we shall add a feature where the user will be able to interact with a chatbot. This chatbot can provide information related to the virus to the user. Such as the symptoms being faced by the patient and whether these symptoms require immediate medical assistance. It can also inform the user of the many restrictions placed by the government in the user's locality. We are also looking forward to improve the User Interface so that a user can have a better experience on our website.
